# Exercise 2: Credit Score Evaluator (Conditionals)
# Concepts: Input, int conversion, if/elif/else, logical operators, chained comparisons.

# Business Context: In banking, evaluate a customer's credit score to determine loan eligibility.

# Task:

# Prompt for a credit score (int, assume 300-850 range).
# Use conditionals to categorize:
# = 750: "Excellent - Loan Approved"

# 700 <= score < 750: "Good - Loan Approved with Review"
# 600 <= score < 700: "Fair - Loan Conditional"
# < 600: "Poor - Loan Denied"
# If score < 300 or > 850, print "Invalid score."
# Add a message: If approved, "Interest rate: Low"; else "Seek credit improvement."
